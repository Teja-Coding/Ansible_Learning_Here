      # The 'split' filter in Ansible is used to split a string into a list
      # based on a specified delimiter.
      #
      # Syntax:
      #   {{ string_variable | split('delimiter') }}
      #
      # Explanation:
      # - It takes a string and breaks it into multiple elements wherever it finds the delimiter.
      # - The output is a list of individual string items.
      #
      # Example:
      #   technologies = "DevOps, Linux, Shell, Ansible"
      #   {{ technologies | split(',') }}
      #   â†’ ['DevOps', ' Linux', ' Shell', ' Ansible']
      #
      # Note:
      # - Spaces remain after commas unless you trim them manually.
      #   You can use 'map' and 'trim' filters to clean up the spaces:
      #   {{ technologies | split(',') | map('trim') | list }}
      #
      # Output (with trim):
      #   ['DevOps', 'Linux', 'Shell', 'Ansible']
